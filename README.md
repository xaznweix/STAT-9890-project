# STAT-9890-project

This was a project done in my data mining class. The goal of this project was to use different modeling techinques such as lasso, ridge, elastic net and random forest to model the sales price of houses in Ames, Iowa. There were different predictors within this dataset. Some predictors include the physical size of various parts of the house, whether it is close to a train station, the various conditions of the house and the type of neighborhoods that the house is associated with. 
From the results section, we can see that while random forest took comparably longer time to run the model, the random forest model has a greater and a much narrower range. If we wanted a shorter time to compute the model while maintaining the best test performance, we can choose the lasso regression model. The three linear regression models are similar to each other (lasso, ridge and elastic net). All three of these model suggest that the neighborhoods within Ames Iowa has a positive effect on the sales price of the house. In contrast to that, the condition of the house can negatively inflence the sale price of the house. For example, if a house is severly damaged, it could drive down the price of the house.
